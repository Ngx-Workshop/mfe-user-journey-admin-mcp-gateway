# Agent entry point — mfe-user-journey-admin-mcp-gateway

This repository is the Angular admin MCP Gateway console for Ngx-Workshop. Assume you have
access to this repository only. The shell, gateway, services, and shared libraries
are separate repositories; their source is not required to understand this remote.

## Read before implementation

1. [Constitution](.specify/memory/constitution.md): durable design rules.
2. [Architecture](docs/architecture.md): responsibilities, source map, external contracts.
3. [Development](docs/development.md): commands, verification, known limitations.
4. [Workflow](.specify/README.md): specify → plan → tasks → implement → verify.
5. The relevant feature folder listed in [specs](specs/README.md), if one exists.

For a newly cloned product repository, also follow [seed adoption](docs/seed-adoption.md).
All links above resolve within this checkout. Do not assume a sibling repository exists.

## Working rules

- Inspect relevant source and `git status` before editing; preserve unrelated changes.
- Follow the user's requested scope. For a feature or behavior change, maintain a
  feature spec, plan, task list, and handoff using the local templates. Small docs
  edits and mechanical fixes can use a concise change/verification summary.
- Documentation describes intent and a source snapshot; executable code describes
  current behavior. Record discrepancies explicitly rather than copying a defect
  into a new implementation or silently changing the intended behavior.
- Keep the default `App` export, `Routes` export, federation exposures, and shared
  dependency compatibility intact unless the task includes changing that contract.
- Use feature folders under `src/app/features/<feature>`: api, models, state,
  forms, utils, pages and components grouped by responsibility. Specs belong in
  `testing/app`, mirroring production folders; runtime never imports testing.
- Use MVVM: stateless API clients own HTTP; root singleton stores own shared server
  state and data orchestration; scoped view models own view/form state. Components
  orchestrate composition/lifecycle or present typed inputs and emit user intent.
  Nested orchestration is allowed when it reflects distinct responsibilities.
- Use standalone OnPush components with inline HTML/SCSS, BEM class names and shell
  theme tokens. Aim for about 230 lines; document cohesive exceptions instead of
  hiding code or splitting only for a line count.
- Use switchMap for replaceable reads, concatMap for ordered writes when required,
  exhaustMap for duplicate-sensitive commands and lifetime-bound subscriptions.
- Run `npm run check:architecture` alongside appropriate tests/builds.
- Keep API calls in stateless API clients and use published contract types. Do not recreate a
  backend or load another remote inside this remote to work around missing access.
- Resolve routine implementation choices and record assumptions. Ask only for
  missing decisions that materially affect requirements or external compatibility;
  continue independent work while a decision is pending.
- Verify changed behavior with the checks in the development guide. Report checks
  actually run, failures, and checks blocked by missing infrastructure separately.
- Update affected context docs when architecture, commands, or contracts change.
  End with a concise result and any remaining integration work.
